				This patent defines a Policy Class structure that can be used to implement NGAC Policy Classes at scale.
Introducing new policy classes in a running NGAC system is challenging, as it is very easy to break access to objects that
had existing access control policies and start participating in the new Policy Classes. This Policy Class structure can
be used to safely introduce new Policy Classes and gradually migrate and add existing objects to them.

mitigate vulnerabilities like the <code>Log4Shell</code> one.<br>
The <a href="https://github.com/tetratelabs/nist-demo-2022">demo</a> also shows the development of custom WASM-based policies that can leverage the entire feature set of the programming
language of choice to build rich access policies that can be enforced by the mesh.

				In the world of microservices, we have seen this new technology, the Service Mesh
emerge and grow very fast. Projects like <a href="http://istio.io">Istio</a>, <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a> or
<a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> have become very popular and people are starting to adopt them and figuring out
the new possibilities these projects bring. But beyond the individual features each of those projects provide,
in this talk, we will present the core concepts of a Service Mesh, the novel things this technology brings, and
the use cases it is meant to solve.<br>
We will explore how Service Meshes will push networking to the next level, opening the door to a whole new set of
possibilities especially designed for this new era of multi-cloud and hybrid architectures, and giving us a mental model
with which to explore and evaluate after the talk.

				NGAC is a fundamental reworking of traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of
the modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. NGAC is based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide
access control services for a number of different types of resources, accessed by a number of different types of
applications and users.<br>
In this joint talk with <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/david-ferraiolo">David Ferraiolo</a> from <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>
we introduced NGAC and did a live demo showing how it can be applied to augment traditional RBAC with high level
concepts xsuch as time and location in an efficient and scalable way.

production, or both? Using pictures and demos, we’ll find out! This session also briefly covered how a service mesh
works, giving us a mental model with which to explore and evaluate after the talk.
